# election22

This is a repository for results of the 2022 election in the US. The data was grabbed from [Politico's website](https://www.politico.com/2022-election/results) at a 5 minute interval from a few minutes after polls closed. Data is currently only from the general election, but I will add data from any runoffs which occur. 

If you are reading this currently, that means I have not processed the data to make it easier to understand. I will do that in the next few days (i think). If it is a considerable time since the last commit, feel free to open an issue to remind me to do it.
